Glad to see you here. My name is Qian Liu (刘乾), currently a final year Ph.D. in Beihang University. My Ph.D. advisor is **Qinping Zhao** & **Bin Zhou**. Meawhile, I am also very lucky to participate the joint program with Microsoft Reserach Asia, co-advised by **Jian-Guang Lou**.

## <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I Love Doing Research

In the past few years, my reserach interest focuses on **semantic parsing** and **dialogue**:
* Semantic Parsing: focusing on techniques to improve semantic parsing.
* Dialogue System: focusing on solutions for coreference and ellipsis.

I am also familiar with reinforcement learning such as Policy Gradient and Self-play, which have been successfully employed on our reserach projects.

## <i class="fa fa-ft fa-hands-helping"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I Enjoy Imparting Knowledge

I am passionate as Teaching Assistants (TA) for several courses, including Computer Organization, Operating System and Software Engineering. I have led the writing of an [guidebook (Chinese)](https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book) for Operating System (in Chinese). 

In 2017, to spread my experience as TA to the younger TAs, I founded the first undergraduate teaching assistant organization **S.T.A.R**. The introduction of S.T.A.R can be found [here (Chinese)](https://www.cnblogs.com/SivilTaram/p/ta_road.html), and the official white paper can be found [here (Chinese)](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/bkspy/bkspy/S_T_A_Rjftdbps_.htm).

In 2021, to promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the **MLNLP community**. I am also honored to be the first rotating chair of the MLNLP community.
