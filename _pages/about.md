## <i class="fa fa-ft fa-info-circle"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Me

Glad to see you here. My name is Qian Liu, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. in Beihang University. My Ph.D. advisor is **Qinping Zhao** & **Bin Zhou**. Meawhile, I am also very lucky to participate the joint program with Microsoft Reserach Asia, co-advised by **Jian-Guang Lou**.

In the past few years, my reserach interest focuses on **semantic parsing**, **dialogue** and **compositional generalization**:
* **Semantic Parsing**: *focusing on techniques to improve conversational semantic parsing*
* **Dialogue System**: *focusing on solutions for coreference and ellipsis*
* **Compositional Generalization**: *focusing on algorithms on improving compositional generalization ability of current models*

I am also familiar with reinforcement learning such as **Policy Gradient**, **Self-play**, **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**, which have been successfully employed on our reserach projects.

Outside of seeking Ph.D., I am passionate as Teaching Assistants for several courses, including Computer Organization, Operating System and Software Engineering. I have led the writing of an [guidebook](https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book) for Operating System (in Chinese), and developed a FAQ bot for teaching.
