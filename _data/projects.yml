    The second semster of sophomore, luckily, I finish overall experiments in operating system, and gains the full credit. Transplanted from MIT 6.828, Our experiments are based on MIPS architecture. Although the difficulty Level reaches the same as MIT, the accompanying teaching materials are not ideal.
    
    Hereupon, I start to write the guide book, in coperation with two friends. After absoring the key insights from lots of english documents, along with our rich experience in the experiment, we finally make the guidebook. The book is typesetted by Latex, owing one hundred and forty pages. At the same time, we polish the experiment codes and add comments on every necessary function as a supplement.

    As a leader, I make a systematic plan, making the progress of writing carried smoothly. As a writer, I write the 2nd, 4th, 6th chapters and the guide for git in a humorous tone.
